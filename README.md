*Code is divided into three python files: 
  - Student_and_Course_class for functionalities that handles and manage the CSV files
  - gui_ssis2 for the structural code and design of the GUI
  - ssis_gui_main for the GUI functionality and it may also serve as a bridge between the gui_ssis2 and Student_and_Course_class

Used pandas library for data manipulation.
Used Qt Designer to design GUI (PyQT5 version).
